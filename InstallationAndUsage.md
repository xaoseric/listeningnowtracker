Note! When this application tries to update the song title for the first time in Skype, it may throw a warning message about external application using Skype. You have to go to Skype application and press "approve" button. See Skype and external application support for more information.

Please see also **ListeningNowTracker.ini file** (must be in the folder with the executable file) if you want to customize the Skype text.

You should see a small tray icon on the toolbar when this application is running. Move mouse cursor on top of that tray icon to see possible error messages. Or select "Exit" from popup menu to quit the application.

The application is WindowsXP, Windows Vista and Windows 7 compatible (32-bit application, but works in 64-bit Windows also in 32-bit compatible mode).

# Source code #

There is also source code version available if you wanna modify or compile the application yourself (or just to see how it works).

  * Checkout sources with Subversion tool (see Source tab page)
  * Use your favourite Windows Win32 C/C++ compiler to compile it (you have to create the Makefile for your own compiler if you are not using Microsoft Visual C++)

Compilation of the pre-built binary version available here is made with "Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition", so that or newer version of Visual C++ environment should work out of the box (as long it has Win32 libraries and not just .NET libraries. This application doesn't use .NET).

See following web pages for more information about Microsoft's Visual C++ Express Edition (free tools at least for non-commercial usage)
  * Official Microsoft site http://www.microsoft.com/express/
  * Semi-official Wikipedia page http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Visual_Studio_Express
  * Unofficial http://www.codeproject.com/KB/applications/FreeVS2005Win32.aspx web site about how to tweak the VC++ 2005 Express Edition (does not apply to newer versions of VC++)

Note! If you just wanna use the application then you can download the pre-compiled binary version from "Downloads" tab page, so you don't have to compile it unless you really want to.
